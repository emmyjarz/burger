# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, the burger will display on the left side of the page and waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
